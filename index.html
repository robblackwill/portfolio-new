            <h2>Aspiring Developer eager to to learn and grow. </h2>
            <p>
                Through learning and through the opportunities being involved in the Generation jr web developer course, I have gained experience with HTML, CSS, typescript, jQuery, bootstrap, JavaScript and React.js
            </p>
            <p>
                I am not saying im to be fully fluent or an expert in any of these areas, However the development i have made throughout the course which can be seen via the portfolio peices below, Demonstrates to any potential employer the scope which I have to grow and how that could be nurtured for benefit of a business.

                <p>
                    after many years of working in bar , and warehouse/admin for sky , a short while at kfc and most recently as a personal transport
                    assistant taking vulnerable children to and from school, I felt a change was needed , Ive always known some basics to coding but when a family 
                    member told me about the course at generation ,I thought this is it , ive always had an interest in tech and coding so why not !?
                    and how i have grown from only knowing the basics to being able to code my own website!, and a profile pieces to go with it!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have had leadership positions during my bar work and working for sky, But can work in a team and individually,
                    I don’t profess to be fluent in all languages but am confident my skills are  more than up for the task, And always ready to hone my skills and learn more, seeking an opportunity to work within a team of exceptional developers , 
                    and to join an organisation where the opportunity for growth and personal development is embraced
